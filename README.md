<h3>Setup</h3>
To run the application just browse to executable/Online Testing Centre/ and run the OTC jar file found in that location. The sourcecode folder contains the source code for the application. Also if you want to view the data used by the application go to the executable/Online Testing Centre/Data folder. 

You will also need:

1. A ODBC Microsoft Access Driver DSN named "assign_con" that points to the assign_data.mdb file in the Data folder.


That's it!!
